const add = (firstNumber:number, secondNumber:number = 5) => firstNumber + secondNumber; // As you can see in ES6 we can set a default value for a parameter. But in ES5 we can't do that. But remember the default parameters only work for the last parameter in the function, Because if we set a default value for a parameter, and we don't pass a value for that parameter, the default value will be used.

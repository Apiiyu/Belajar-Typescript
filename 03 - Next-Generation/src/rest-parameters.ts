const sumNumbers = (...numbers: number[]): number => numbers.reduce((currentResult: number, currentValue:number):number => currentResult + currentValue) // As we know, in ES6 there have amazing features, one of them is rest parameters. Rest parameters is used to merge multiple arguments into an array. And we can use rest parameters to merge multiple arguments into an array. As you can see in the example above, we try to use rest parameters to take every arguments that we pass to the function, and then we merge them into an array. And then we use reduce method to sum all the elements in the array.
